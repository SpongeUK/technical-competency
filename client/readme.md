Hello,

Thank you for looking at our My Movie DB application.

Our aim is to provide movie facts, information and review to our AV community, eventually we would like to be able 
to offer recommendations and paid for promotions to our members.

There are a few things that our team and users have fed back on that we would like addressed.

Users often comment that they think the page is broken on first load because there are no movies showing initially.

When the list does load, it is showing the movies in order of release, oldest first, but we think that
the newest releases should come first instead!

We would also like to be able to just browse Action films, Drama or comedy. This should help users find similar titles
while we work on our recommendations engine. The genres are: 

*    Science Fiction
*    Action
*    Adventure
*    Biography
*    Drama
*    Comedy
*    Horror
*    Crime
*    Thriller  

We would like promote the current paid for movies from our partners. There is a list of title provided in the 
data file `paid-promotions.json`. These titles should appear in a banner at the above the movie list along with 
the matching poster. I've included these in the directory `images/posters`

Finally we would like to be able to view the movie's cast as well. If this could link to the other movies that 
the cast member has starred in that would be amazing!

Thanks so much!

Barry
